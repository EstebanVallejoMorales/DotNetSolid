# SOLID Principles Practice Project

This project is intended as a practical exercise to understand and apply the SOLID principles in software development. SOLID is an acronym that represents five fundamental principles of object-oriented design, aimed at creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible software solutions.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility. When a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes difficult to maintain, test, and evolve. By adhering to SRP, we achieve code that is more focused and easier to understand.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

   The Open-Closed Principle encourages the software entities (classes, modules, functions) to be open for extension but closed for modification. In simpler terms, this principle promotes adding new functionality by extending existing code rather than changing it. This helps maintain existing functionality and minimizes the risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   The Liskov Substitution Principle emphasizes that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies maintain their contracts and avoid breaking existing code when new derived classes are introduced.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It encourages the creation of specific, minimalistic interfaces tailored to the needs of clients. By following ISP, we prevent the creation of overly large, monolithic interfaces that lead to unnecessary dependencies.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   The Dependency Inversion Principle promotes the inversion of dependencies in a way that high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This facilitates flexibility and ease of testing, as well as decoupling components within the system.

# Getting Started

To begin practicing the SOLID principles with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**

   git clone https://github.com/EstebanVallejoMorales/DotNetSolid.git

3. Explore the codebase and identify areas where SOLID principles were applied.
